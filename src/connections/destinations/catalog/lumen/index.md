## Supported methods

Lumen supports the following methods, as specified in the [Segment Spec](/docs/connections/spec).

### Identify

Send [Identify](/docs/connections/spec/identify) calls to create or update a user's record. The `userId` becomes the user's primary identifier.

```js
analytics.identify('userId123', {
  email: 'john.doe@example.com'
});
```

If the identifier doesn't exist, a new user record is created. If the identifier already exist, we update the user record For example:

Segment sends Identify calls to Lumen as an `identify` event.


### Track

Send [Track](/docs/connections/spec/track) calls to track a user's activity or action. For example:

```js
analytics.track('Login Button Clicked')
```

Segment sends Track calls to Lumen as a `track` event.
