> **Good to know**: This page is about the [Actions-framework](/docs/connections/destinations/actions/) <destination_name> Segment destination. There's also a page about the [non-Actions <destination_name> destination](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/<destination_name>/). Both of these destinations receives data from Segment.

## Benefits of Heap (Actions) vs Heap Classic

Heap (Actions) provides the following benefits over the classic Heap destination:

- **More control with clearer mapping**. Actions-based destinations enable you to define the mapping between the data Segment receives from your source, and the data Segment sends to the destination.

- **Increased transparency**. All Segment ingested events will display the Segment icon in Heap to easily identify the source of the event, and foster greater data trust

- **Improved setup**. Easier default settings make it easier to get set up faster

## Getting started

1. From the Segment web app, click **Catalog**, then click **Destinations**.
2. Find the Destinations Actions item in the left navigation, and click it.
3. Click **Configure Heap**.
4. Select an existing Source to connect to Heap (Actions).
